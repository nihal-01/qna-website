                        QNA mission is to share and grow the world&#39;s
                        knowledge. A vast amount of the knowledge that would be
                        valuable to many people is currently only available to a
                        few â€” either locked in people&#39;s heads, or only
                        accessible to select groups. We want to connect the
                        people who have knowledge to the people who need it, to
                        bring together people with different perspectives so
                        they can understand each other better, and to empower
                        everyone to share their knowledge for the benefit of the
                        rest of the worldu

                        mission, we&#39;re going to make a big impact on the
                        world. We just need to get a smart group of people
                        together that can get us there.
